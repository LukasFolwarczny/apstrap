apstrap - Arch Linux Prvak bootstrap

A simplification of the tedious process of installing a system.
I hope to make my Arch installation as easy as "./apstrap.sh".

The script expects all filesystems to be in place. Run it after
chrooting to a system with base packages installed. It also
needs an internet connection to install packages.
