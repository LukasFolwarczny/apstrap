apstrap - Arch Linux Folwar bootstrap
2014 Lukáš Folwarczný <lfolwarczny@gmail.com>

About
-----

Fork of the original Prvak bootstrap which I am modifying to install
Arch the way I do rather than Michal does.

A simplification of the tedious process of installing a system.
The whole installation process should be as easy as "./apstrap.sh".

Usage
-----

The script expects all filesystems to be in place. Run it after
chrooting to a system with base packages installed. It also
needs an internet connection to install packages.
